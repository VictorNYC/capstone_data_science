# capstone_project
Over the past few months, I've been working on my Data Science Capstone Project: An Exploratory Data Analysis on how audio features play a role on popularity scores of specific artists and genres. 🧑🏻‍💻🎸🎵🎶🎧🪗


- CSV's originals contains original csv web scraped from Spotify.
- CSV's cleaned are the ones after cleaning data and I used this one for the notebook where I concatenated all genres to model all genres.
- EDA's modeling and web scraping contains how I web scraped, the 6 EDA and models for each genre, and then the EDA and model with all the genres.
- Zips with visuals are screen shots of the visuals on the jupyter notebooks, plus visuals I used on my slide decks presentation.
- Slide decks file.

If you are a student, I hope this document helps you. If you are an experienced passioned for data, please I will like to hear feedback or collaborate on any exciting projects.

I am only uploading this work to share it via Github link whenever I want or for my portfolio.

Enjoy!, Victor Cornejo New York, NY April 2024
