Over the past few months, I've been working on my Data Science Capstone Project: An Exploratory Data Analysis on how audio features play a role on popularity scores of specific artists and genres. 
🎸🎵🎧🎶🪗🧑🏻‍💻

In a nutshell, I created an algorithm that tells you if you can predict the popularity of a new song of a popular artist, based solely on statistical methods that include the following audio features: danceability, tempo, “happiness”, acoustic and more, and using web-scraped data from studio albums available on Spotify, I included the following six genres: Pop, Reggaeton, Electronic, Rap, Classical, and Rock. 

Machine learning methods helped show that the popularity of a future song can in fact be predicted. The results also showed that each genre of music has its strength in an audio feature that gives it positive correlation with increasing popularity scores. In contrast, each genre of music has its weakness in an audio feature that has a negative correlation to decreased popularity scores.

If you are a student, I hope this document helps you! If you are an experienced passioned for data, please I would love to connect, hear feedback or collaborate on any exciting projects!

My work contains 9 zip folders, numerated from 0 to 8, and you should open them in that order for a cronologic understanding. And a separate PDF that contains a slide deck presentation that I used more Demo Day at BrainStation, 136 Crosby St, 4th floor, New York, NY, 10012, on April 18 of 2024.
